Compiling:
To use the code as provided you need to change "String path = "C:\\Users\\Justin\\eclipse-workspace\\userSQL.txt"; located in InitializeDao @ Line 69. The method will be looking for a text file provided in Github.

I don't believe there should be any issues with compiling the code, using EclipseEE
Tomcat v8.0
Java 1.8
mysql-connector-java-8.0.11.jar
jstl-1.2.jar
